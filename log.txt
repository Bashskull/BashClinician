A blood pressure reading of 130/85 mmHg falls into the category of stage 1 hypertension according to the American Heart Association's guidelines. Here's what it means:

- **Systolic pressure (the top number)**: 130 mmHg is slightly above the normal range (less than 120 mmHg).
- **Diastolic pressure (the bottom number)**: 85 mmHg is also slightly above the normal range (less than 80 mmHg).

While this reading is not severely high, it is a sign that you may need to monitor your blood pressure more closely and consider lifestyle modifications to bring it back into the normal range. Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Lifestyle changes**: Adopt a heart-healthy diet, increase physical activity, maintain a healthy weight, manage stress, and limit alcohol and salt intake.
2. **Monitor your blood pressure**: Keep track of your blood pressure readings over time to see if it improves or worsens.
3. **Consult a healthcare professional**: Discuss your blood pressure reading with your doctor, who can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and other factors.

A single reading of 130/85 mmHg is not immediately concerning, but consistent readings in this range may indicate a need for further evaluation and potential treatment. Always consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation.
